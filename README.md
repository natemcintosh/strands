# Strands

This CLI program attempts to solve the [strands](https://www.nytimes.com/games/strands) game by:
1. finding words that can exist on the board
1. finding the right combination of words that cover the board with no overlap, or crossing each other.

It can currently do 1, but I have so far struggled to implement a check for words crossing over each other that is fast enough.
